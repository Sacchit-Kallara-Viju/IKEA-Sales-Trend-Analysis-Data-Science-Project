KEY INSIGHTS

Sales and profit show a strong positive correlation, indicating that higher revenue directly contributes to higher profitability.

Quantity sold has a weak correlation with profit, suggesting pricing and product value play a larger role than volume alone.

Certain product categories contribute disproportionately more to total profit.

Sales trends show consistent performance with identifiable growth periods.

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

Focus on high-margin products rather than high-quantity products.

Optimize pricing strategies to maximize profitability.

Use category-level and regional insights for better inventory and marketing planning.

CONCLUSION

This analysis provides actionable insights that can help IKEA improve profitability, optimize sales strategies, and make informed business decisions using data-driven methods.

FUTURE SCOPE

Implement predictive sales forecasting using machine learning.
Analyze customer-level purchasing behavior.
Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau.
